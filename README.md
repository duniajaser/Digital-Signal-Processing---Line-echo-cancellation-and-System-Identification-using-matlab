# Digital-Signal-Processing---Line-echo-cancellation-and-System-Identification-using-matlab
This project aims to solve the problem of echoes 
during phone calls. Sometimes, the sound bounces back and 
creates unwanted noise, making it difficult to hear clearly. To fix 
this, we use a device called an adaptive line echo canceller. It listens 
to the reflected sound and makes a duplicate of the echo. Then, it 
subtracts this echo from the original sound, making it more 
understandable. The improved sound is then sent back to the other 
person, making the conversation better and echo-free.
